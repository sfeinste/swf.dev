# Updating Photo Galleries

To add new photos to the galleries:

1. Add your photos to the appropriate folder:
   - `photos/astro/` for astrophotography
   - `photos/wildlife/` for wildlife photos  
   - `photos/misc/` for everything else

2. Run the script to regenerate the photo lists:
   ```bash
   ./generate-photo-list.sh
   ```

3. The galleries will automatically display the new photos

Note: Supported formats are JPG, JPEG, PNG (case insensitive)
